## CI Test Comparison

This folder contains the script to run different CI tests for different settings considered in the evaluation of our paper (Sec. 5).
Each CI test's results are stored separately. We provide our experiment results and further include the evaluation script that outputs the figures provided within the paper and its appendix.
Note that for the adaptive histogram-based test, we use a timeout (set to 10 minutes), as runs for high dimensions of $Z$ partially did not finish within a day.
